# Changes Summary - October 14, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Fixed News Page Mobile Navbar Overlap
**Problem**: The text "Latest News Stay updated with..." was clipping into the navbar on mobile devices.

**Solution**: Added padding-top to the news hero section for mobile breakpoints:
- `@media (max-width: 768px)`: Added `padding-top: calc(80px + 2rem)`
- `@media (max-width: 480px)`: Added `padding-top: calc(80px + 1.5rem)`

**Files Changed**:
- `templates/news.html`

### 2. ✅ Removed "Ocean Protection" from Environmental Impact
**Problem**: Ocean Protection section needed to be removed from the environmental impact statistics.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the "Ocean Protection" card from the environmental impact grid
- Updated translation keys from `impact_env4` to `impact_env3` for Community Engagement
- Renumbered all environmental impact items (now 3 instead of 4)

**Files Changed**:
- `templates/index.html`

---

### 3. ✅ Added "As of (Current Date)" to Statistics
**Problem**: Statistics needed to display the current date to show freshness of data.

**Solution**:
- Added date display below the impact section title
- Implemented JavaScript to format date based on current language (ID/EN)
- Indonesian format: "Per tanggal [Tanggal Bulan Tahun]"
- English format: "As of [Month Day, Year]"

**Files Changed**:
- `templates/index.html`

### 4. ✅ Automated Daily Statistics Update at 8 PM WIB

   - Sets up logging
   - Makes script executable

3. **`setup_daily_update.bat`** - Windows setup script:
   - Creates Windows Task Scheduler task
   - Schedules for 8 PM WIB
   - Handles admin permissions

4. **`README_DAILY_UPDATE.md`** - Complete documentation:
   - Setup instructions for both platforms
   - Testing procedures
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Monitoring instructions

#### How to Use:
